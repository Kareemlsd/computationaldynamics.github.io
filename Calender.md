At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define and analyse numerical methods to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This entails:<br>
<b>1.Define a simple solver to approximate solutions of ODEs based on Taylor Series</b> <br>
2.Quantify the numerical error of an approximated solution <br>
3.Define adaptive time stepping approaches to control the numerical error <br>
4.Distinguish between different ODE solvers <br>
