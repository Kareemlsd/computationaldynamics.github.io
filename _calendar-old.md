# Calender

This page gives an overview of the in-class sessions, homework assignments and reading material. See the [unit information](index.html) page for more info about this unit.

### [Week 1](Weeks/Week1.html)

At the end of this week you will be able to: <br>
Define and analyse numerical methods to solve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This entails:<br>
<i>1. Define a simple solver to approximate solutions of ODEs based on Taylor Series</i> <br>
<i>2. Quantify the numerical error of an approximated solution</i><br>
<i>3. Define adaptive time stepping approaches to control the numerical error</i><br>
<i>4. Distinguish between different ODE solvers</i><br>
